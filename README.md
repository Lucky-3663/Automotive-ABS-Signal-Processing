# 🚗 ABS Wheel Speed Sensor Signal Processing

## 📌 Project Overview
This project simulates an automotive wheel speed sensor signal with realistic road vibration and electrical noise. A Butterworth low-pass filter is applied to remove high-frequency disturbances. FFT analysis is performed to identify dominant frequency components and justify filter cutoff selection. A deceleration-based logic is implemented to detect potential ABS activation conditions.

### Analysis
The Graph represents the wheel deceleration profile during ABS activation.
It shows how braking force varies with time to prevent wheel lock-up.
The smooth deceleration curve indicates controlled braking, which improves vehicle stability and reduces stopping distance.
